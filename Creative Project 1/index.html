        <p class = "propaganda-text">Welcome to Cryptopolis! We are a safe and prosperous nation under the guidance of our Supreme Leader Semyon Lukichev. Our mandatory military service along with strong civil rights protections grant us a strong army of diverse yet equal peoples. Elections are held whenever the Supreme Leader feels like it, organ harvesting upon death is mandatory, corruption is... totally under control, and every citizen is required to be happy by law. Come visit us and stimulate our local economy with your tourist money! Our borders occupy nearly all of modern day Brazil, where our struggle for statehood first began. Us Cryptopians are strong, resilient, hardworking and hospitable people. While some international organizations criticize our dear Leader for silly things such as numerous violations of the Geneva convention, undermining democracy, and countless human rights abuses, moving to Cryptopolis will help you see past that. Re-education if you will! We can't wait for your arrival :)</p>
